# LongestSubStringInMatrix
Given a two-dimensional square array of (any) characters, return the longest string of equal adjacent characters.

To achieve this, it searches every vertical, diagonal, and horizontal in the array.


This solution has 3 projects:

1- Console - Presentation layer from where the algorithm is executed.

2- Domain - Domain class that contains business logic to solve the problem.

3- File Reader - Project in charge of reading a .txt file which contains an array of characters.

Said file can be modified, it must comply with the following:

  3.1 The characters have no separation, they are just continuous characters.
  
  3.2 Each line break represents a new row in the matrix.

This solution does not contain external libraries, it is only necessary to do a restore from Visual Studio and compile.
The main project is the "Console".
